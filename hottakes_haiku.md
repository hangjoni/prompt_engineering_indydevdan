# Vercel v0: Leaked System Prompts and the Pivot to Openness

## High Level Summary
The leaked system prompts from Vercel's LLM-assisted development platform, v0, reveal a shift in the company's approach from a focus on protecting the prompt to embracing a more open and transparent model. This pivot reflects the maturity of the product and the company's recognition that the prompt alone is not enough, and the importance of the surrounding infrastructure and user experience.

## Main Points
1. Vercel v0 is one of the most mature products in the LLM-assisted development market, having been iterated on since its launch in October last year.
2. The company was initially paranoid about protecting the prompt with complex pre- and post-processing, but has since pivoted to a more open approach.
3. Vercel CTO Malte Ubl stated that a prompt without the necessary evals, models, and user experience is like getting a broken machine without a manual.
4. The leaked prompts provide a glimpse into the inner workings of Vercel's LLM-assisted development platform.

## Sentiment
The sentiment conveyed in the leaked information and the Vercel CTO's comments suggests a shift towards a more open and transparent approach to LLM-assisted development. The company seems to have recognized the limitations of a closed-off system and the importance of providing a comprehensive user experience, rather than focusing solely on the prompt itself.

## Hot Takes Biased Towards the Author
1. Vercel's pivot to openness demonstrates a willingness to learn and adapt, which is crucial in the rapidly evolving field of LLM-assisted development.
2. The leaked prompts provide valuable insights into the company's development process, which could be beneficial for the broader community.
3. Vercel's commitment to improving the user experience of its LLM-assisted platform is a positive step forward in making this technology more accessible and user-friendly.

## Hot Takes Biased Against the Author
1. The initial focus on protecting the prompt could be seen as a defensive move, suggesting a lack of confidence in the product's core technology.
2. The leaked prompts may have been an unintended consequence of the company's pivot to openness, which could raise concerns about the security and privacy of user data.
3. Vercel's reliance on LLMs for its core product could be seen as a risk, as the technology is still relatively new and may not be suitable for mission-critical applications.
